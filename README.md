Iâ€™m Mansi Maurya

Iâ€™m a Software Developer and currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Advanced Software Development at TU Dublin. With 3 years of professional experience at Standard Chartered Bank, Iâ€™ve worked on designing, developing, and deploying backend systems that handle real-time, large-scale data. My work has given me a strong foundation in software architecture, system optimization, and problem-solving.

Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable, impactful, and user-centric applications â€” from backend services to intelligent web platforms. My interests lie in the areas of machine learning, data-driven systems, and cloud-native applications.
